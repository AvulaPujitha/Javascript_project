# Javascript_project
I learned JavaScript and built a project using it. While working on the project, I practiced writing code, fixing errors, and making web pages interactive. I used concepts like functions, events, and DOM manipulation. This helped me understand how JavaScript works in real projects. Now, I feel more confident coding in JavaScript.
